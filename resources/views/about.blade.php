                    The Climate Action Plan Tracker and Information Network of the United Nations referred to as “CAPTAIN UN” 
                    is a platform hosted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

                    The CAPTAIN UN platform is the reimagining of bringing people and information technology together with a collective 
                    goal and objective of admonishing for action and accountability from government and major corporate entities regarding promises 
                    made as a result of the Paris Climate Accords of 2015. 
                    192 member states are signatories to the climate agreement which came into effect in November 2016.
                </p>

                The tracking of climate plans by governments and corporations is a collective one as the benefits of achieving them will transcend generations untold. 
                Therefore, UNDP and UNICEF welcome all of you, our Eco Champions, to this information network as we strive to save our world together.
